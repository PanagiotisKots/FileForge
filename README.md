C++ File Operations Command-Line Interface

This Command-Line File Utility serves as an educational resource and practical exercise for individuals learning C++ programming and seeking hands-on experience with file manipulation and command-line interfaces. Designed with simplicity and educational value in mind, this utility provides a structured environment for exploring fundamental concepts of file I/O, error handling, and command-line argument parsing.


Key Learning Objectives:

    File Management Fundamentals:
        Gain a deeper understanding of file creation, reading, updating, and deletion operations,
        essential for mastering file manipulation techniques in C++ programming.

    C++ Language Proficiency:
        Practice core C++ programming concepts, including functions, file streams, string manipulation, error handling,
        and command-line argument parsing, within a real-world application context.

    Error Handling and Debugging:
        Learn effective error handling strategies and debugging techniques to identify and 
        resolve common issues encountered during file operations and program execution.

    Command-Line Interface Interaction:
        Explore command-line interface (CLI) interaction by implementing command
        parsing logic and interpreting user input to perform desired file operations.

Educational Benefits:

    Hands-On Learning Experience:
        Engage in practical exercises that reinforce theoretical concepts,
        providing a hands-on learning experience essential for mastering C++ programming skills.

=>    The Command-Line File Utility serves as a valuable educational resource and practical learning tool for individuals seeking to enhance their C++ programming skills and gain proficiency in file manipulation and command-line interface interaction. Through structured exercises and real-world applications, users can explore core programming concepts, develop problem-solving abilities, and cultivate a deeper understanding of C++ programming principles in an engaging and interactive environment.



*******************
Usage Instructions:
*******************

    Usage:
        To use this command-line utility, follow the instructions below:
            Create a File:
         

           $ ./file_utility create <filename>

*******************
Read File Contents:
*******************
            

            $ ./file_utility read <filename>

*************
Update File:
*************
         
           
           $ ./file_utility update <filename> <content>

************
Delete File:
************

            

            $ ./file_utility delete <filename>

**************************
Installation Instructions:
**************************
    Prerequisites:
        C++ compiler (e.g., g++) if on windows, if in linux you have it preinstalled
    Installation:
        Clone the repository:
    

          $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-utility.git

          Navigate to the project directory:

         

          $ cd file-utility
************************
Compile the source code:
***********************

          $ g++ main.cpp -o file_utility

*****************************************
Run the program with the desired command:
*****************************************
    

     $ ./file_utility <command> [arguments]

Tip: if in linux, you can try: 
     
     $ ./file_utility <command> [arguments] 2> filename.txt 
and you will be redirecting the error-out stream instead of the screen to a file you specify and create.
